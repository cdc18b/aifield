I picked epsilon-greedy because the rewards are continuous and noisy, so a small fixed chance of random exploration keeps testing other arms while mostly exploiting the best average so far, whereas random wastes pulls, greedy can lock in too early, UCB can stop exploring too hard (or be sensitive to tuning), and the basic Thompson method assumes 0/1 (Bernoulli) rewards.
